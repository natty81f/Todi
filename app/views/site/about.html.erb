		<p>This app is based upon the idea that people love to record their daily lives but don't necessarily have the time or desire to write a novel or blog post about it. </p>

		<p>I decided to create a simple and quick, almost intuitive way for people to write about their daily musings, experiences and mood. A sort of digital diary for the busy modern world. One of the early questions I asked myself when I was developing the idea was, "What would be an app that people in Japan - people living in a high-paced society, people preoccupied with design and fun graphic visuals - would want to use to record their lives?". That's how Todi the app was born. </p>
