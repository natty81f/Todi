Todi:
========

https://trello.com/b/oVlx20vb/wdi-project-todi 

An app where you chose an icon(Todi face: happy, sad, confused, etc.) which represents your mood of the day. Based on the icon you chose you will then write a message(today I wasâ€¦ or today I learned) that will be saved to the database. Later you will be able to search your history and pull results by:

- date (you can select a range: start date to end date)
- moods (Todi face: happy, sad, tired, etc.)

Future features: 

- Share this Todi message card with your friends.
- Send  a report of your emotion_type (moods) to your email.
